## Asset Importer
This mod allows you to import custom assets into the game. Custom Assets are already partially supported by the game and this mod allows to share Asset Packs on PDX Mods using Custom Asset Packs. Please visit the GitHub Page to find a list of currently available Asset Packs.

### Please note you have to restart the game after subscribing to an Asset Pack
Subscribe -> Start Game -> Close Game -> Start Game
There is also a notification in the main menu to restart the game if needed.

## DISCLAIMER

Unofficial Custom Assets are highly experimental. They WILL crash your game at some point or throw errors. Create redundand copies of your savefiles and use at your own risk. There has not been a lot of testing done on custom assets, and I'm publishing this project to get feedback from the community.
