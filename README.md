## Asset Packs Manager
This mod used to be needed to import custom assets into the game. Since the Region Packs the game supports assets downloaded from PDX Mods by itself. This mod offers support functionality for using custom asset packs.

## Features
- Support for Playsets
- Thumbnail Support for Legacy Asset Packs (new packs can have thumbnails set in the Editor)
- Localization Support for Legacy Asset Packs (new packs can have localized names and descriptions set in the Editor)
- Overview about loaded Packs and Local Assets
- Create reports with broken/missing assets

## Locally installed assets

APM is not made to provide support for locally installed assets, only some of the features work for local assets. Skyve Warnings, Reports and Overviews might not work with assets that are installed directly in your user folder.
For this reason, it is recommended to use assets subscribed from Paradox Mods instead of using local versions, and asset authors are encouraged to upload assets using the Modding Toolchain to Paradox Mods.

## Troubleshooting

### Errors on Startup
The Cities: Skylines II Logging tool is known to produce errors, especially on startup. If your Error message contains the word "ApmLogger" at any point you can ignore the issue completely.

### Resources for Asset Creation
