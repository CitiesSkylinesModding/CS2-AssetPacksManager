## DISCLAIMER

Unofficial Custom Assets are highly experimental. They WILL crash your game at some point or throw errors. Create redundand copies of your savefiles and use at your own risk. There has not been a lot of testing done on custom assets, and I'm publishing this project to get feedback from the community.


## Support and Contact
Check out the [Custom Asset Pack](https://github.com/kosch104/CS2-CustomAssetPack) Repository to start publishing your own assets.
Contact me on Discord Konsi#1337 or create an issue on this repository for help. There will also be a support discord environment.
