## DISCLAIMER

Unofficial Custom Assets are highly experimental. They WILL crash your game at some point or throw errors. Create redundant copies of your save files and use at your own risk. There has not been a lot of testing done on custom assets, and I'm publishing this project to get feedback from the community.

## Asset Packs Manager (Formerly Asset Importer)
This mod allows you to import custom assets into the game. Custom Assets are already partially supported by the game and this mod allows to share Asset Packs on PDX Mods using Custom Asset Packs. Please visit the GitHub Page to find a list of currently available Asset Packs.
Be careful using Custom Assets and this mod. It is a very early stage

## Features
- Support for Playsets
- Support for Thumbnails
- Support for Localization (Using L18N Everywhere)

## Credit
The code of this mod was created by Konsi and Nullpinter. Thanks to CityRat for the Thumbnail.
